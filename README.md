In this model development we had taken data sets as :
Important attributes are :
age :age of patient
sex : gender of patient
cp : chest pain 
trestbps : BP
chol : cholesterol level 
fbs : Fasting blood sugar level
restecg : Resting electrocardiographic results 
thalach : Maximum heart rate achieved
exang : Exercise-induced angina (1 for yes, 0 for no) 
oldpeak : depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
slope : slope of the peak exercise 
ca :  major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
thal : Thalassemia
target: Level of heart attack (0.1 for lesser and 0.9 for stronger) 

Discription:
Preventing heart diseases has become increasingly crucial in ensuring public health. Effective data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, ultimately enabling more individuals to lead healthier lives. Machine Learning plays a pivotal role in this domain by providing accurate predictions of heart diseases.
The project focused on analyzing a dataset comprising information on heart disease patients, employing rigorous data processing techniques. Subsequently, various machine learning models were trained and evaluated using different algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
Implemented in Python within a Jupyter notebook, the project aimed to predict the presence of heart disease in patientsâ€”a classification problem. Input features encompassed a range of parameters, while the target variable indicated the binary outcome of whether heart disease was present.

Algorithms:
The ML algorithms used in here is :
1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
3. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
4. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Outcomes in terms of accuracy:
The outcomes of all agorithms tested are:
The accuracy score achieved using Logistic Regression is: 85.25 %
The accuracy score achieved using KNN is: 67.21 %
The accuracy score achieved using Decision Tree is: 81.97 %
The accuracy score achieved using Random Forest is: 90.16 %

Conclustion:
The achieved accuracy rate was 90.16% with the Random Forest algorithm, indicating promising results in predicting heart disease.
